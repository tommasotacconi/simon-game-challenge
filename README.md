This is a simple memory game written with HTML <img src="icons/html5-brands-solid.svg" width="15" height="15">,
CSS <img src="icons/css-brands-solid.svg" width="15" height="15"> and JS <img src="icons/js-brands-solid.svg"
width="15" height="15">. It consists of four squares of different colours and the player have to remember the
sequence created by the chosen square added at each level. Have fun and train your brain!

## Really simple interface

Right now no buttons is included, you simply press a keyboard's key and you go. There no time limit, but you
have to be focus, cause the chosen square of a level is chosen only one time. When you make a mistake you
restart the page.
